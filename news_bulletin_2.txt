Here's the latest from STV News. Fire crews are preparing for what the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service calls the busiest night of the year, expecting around 1, 000 calls over Bonfire Night disorder. Firework control zones have been set up in Glaz-go and Edd'n-bra to help manage the situation. Moving on, a speeding driver who killed a young father crossing the road in Edd'n-bra has had his jail term reduced. Evan Davis was running late for work when he exceeded the 40 miles per hour speed limit before the fatal crash.
