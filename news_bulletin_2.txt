Here’s the latest from STV News. Fire crews are preparing for what the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service calls the busiest night of the year, expecting around 1, 000 calls over Bonfire Night disorder. Firework control zones have been set up in Glaz-go and Edd'n-bra to help manage the chaos. Moving on, a speeding driver who killed a young father crossing the road in Edd'n-bra has had his jail term reduced. Evan Davis was driving over the 40 miles per hour limit as he ran late for work. And finally, divers have discovered the wreck of HMS Bayano off the Galloway coast, sunk by a German U-boat in 1915 during World War One. That’s all for now from the STV Newsroom – you’ll find more online.
