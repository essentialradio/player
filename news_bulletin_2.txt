Here's the latest from STV News. Speed restrictions are in place on trains to and from Glazzgo due to an extreme rain weather warning. Services on the West Coast Main Line between Glazzgo and Carlisle, including routes via Dumfries, are affected. Moving on, thousands of pounds have been raised for Glazzgo singer Phil Campbell, lead vocalist of The Temperance Movement, who recently underwent surgery to remove a cyst on his vocal cord. And finally, Scotland’s first Center Parcs in the Scottish Borders is recommended for planning approval despite objections from around 40 local residents.
