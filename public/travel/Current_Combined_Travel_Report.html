        <h2>Travel Bulletin for Essential Radio, with Traffic Scotland – <time datetime="2025-07-24T16:18:39.530784+01:00">Thursday 24 July 2025 16:18</time></h2>
        <p>In Ayrshire and the West this afternoon, you may face delays of around 15 minutes on the A78 from Wemyss Bay towards the A737 at Linwood, and journeys are taking longer than usual on the A737 from Lochwinnoch to Linwood. Expect the usual hold-ups on the A77 between Girvan Roundabout and Stranraer, as well as from Dutch House Roundabout to Whitletts Roundabout. On the A76, delays continue between Kilmarnock and Cumnock. Roadworks could mean slower traffic on the A77 at Shallochpark Roundabout and on the A78 near the A759 entry slip.</p>
