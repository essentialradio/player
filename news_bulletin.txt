Here's the latest from STV News. South Ayrshire Council has approved a five-year plan to boost the use of Gaelic, promoting it in schools, offering staff learning opportunities, and considering bilingual signage, despite little current demand. Moving on, the council is also exploring turning empty shop units into homes to tackle the long waiting list for council housing. And finally, a driver was taken to hospital after a one-vehicle crash on the A760 south of Largs early Monday morning, with the road temporarily closed. That's all for now from the STV Newsroom – you'll find more online.
