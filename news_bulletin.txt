Here’s the latest from STV News. South Ayrshire councillors have dismissed a complaint after a taxi driver, described as ‘baldy, ’ turned up to a hearing with a full head of hair, exposing a hole in the claim. Moving on, a 31-year-old Aberdeen woman, Dionne Wilson, has been convicted of stabbing Sara Irvine to death during an infidelity row at a house in Aberdeen on April 17th. And finally, in Glasgow, a private hire driver locked a woman in his car, refusing to let her get the remaining five pounds twenty she owed.
